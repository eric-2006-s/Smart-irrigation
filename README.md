# Smart-irrigation
This smart irrigation system uses an ESP32 to measure soil moisture and get rain forecasts from Open-Meteo. It waters plants if the soil is very dry or checks for rain before watering if moderately dry. A relay controls the pump, with an LED showing pump status. It saves water and reduces manual effort.
